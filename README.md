Final Project Password Analyzer
# Password Strength Analyzer

## Project Objectives
This Python-based tool evaluates password strength against common attack patterns like brute force and dictionary attacks. It provides real-time feedback, scores passwords (weak/medium/strong), and suggests improvements to enforce secure password policies. Built using PyCharm, Anaconda, and Jupyter Notebook, it enhances security automation by integrating validation into user systems.

## Key Features
- **Evaluation**: Checks length (â‰¥12 chars), diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and patterns using regex and zxcvbn library.
- **Scoring**: Entropy-based scoring with visualizations via matplotlib.
- **Suggestions**: Actionable tips for weak passwords.
- **Database**: SQLite for common password wordlist.
- **Automation**: Real-time validation scripts with logging.
- **AI Integration**: Uses GitHub Copilot for code assistance.
